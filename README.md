# Snake game with JavaScript

During my semester 2 of the ICT & Media study I worked on a snake game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I made use of HTML canvas for the game to be playable.

## The gameplay

As soon as starting up the webpage, you already play the game! The controls for the game are the arrow keys to go up, down, left and right.
You need to catch the yellow blocks for more points and avoid the black blocks, these are bombs! When hitting the bombs or the borders you are dead and it's game over!
